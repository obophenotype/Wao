def: "ADF is a set of two neurons that have dual ciliated endings in the amphid sensillum. The endings are in the amphid channel\, which is open to the outside. Processes from lateral cell bodies enter the ventral cord via the amphidial commissures and turn anteriorly to enter the nerve ring. The processes of ADF run near the outside surface and posterior face of the ring\, in close association with those of AIZ. They meet at the dorsal mid-line and terminate; there is a gap junction at the point or contact. The main synaptic output is to RIA and AIZ; there are also synapses to SMB\, AUA and RIR\, usually in dyadic combinations with RIA or AIZ. AWB synapses onto ADF in several places\,  and there are gap junctions to RIH\, ADA and AIA." [WB:\[cgc938\]]
