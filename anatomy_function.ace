We determined the cell division at which the array had been mitotically lost by scoring the presence or absence of the array in cells that shared a precursor cell with ABaraappaaa at some point of their lineage history. We identified 10 animals that had an extra e3D-like cell and had lost the array at the cell division of ABaraapp (Fig. 3E). This observation indicates that the presence of a functional ngn-1 gene in ABaraapp is insufficient to generate an MI neuron and thus that to generate MI a functional ngn-1 gene is necessary at or later than the stage of ABaraappa, the MI grandmother cell. By contrast, we identified no animals that had lost the array at the next cell division, that of the MI grandmother cell, ABaraappa (Fig. 3E). This result suggests that in all animals in which the array was present in the MI grandmother cell, ABaraappaaa differentiated as normal into an MI neuron whether the array was (Class I animals) or was not (Class II animals) transmitted to the presumptive MI neuron. Thus, the presence of the array in the MI grandmother cell was sufficient to rescue the MI transformation of ngn-1(n1921) mutants. Together, these findings indicate that the presence of the ngn-1 wild-type gene in the MI grandmother cell is both necessary and sufficient to generate an MI neuron and establish left-right asymmetry in the cell lineage."

We observed that mosaic animals retaining the array in AIY were rescued, whereas animals that did not retain the array in AIY, but retained it in other cells, such as postsynaptic partner RIA, were not rescued for the neurite length phenotype in AIY (P<0.001). These mosaic data suggest that DAF-18 acts cell-autonomously in AIY."

We observed that none of the 45 animals in which the array loss had occurred at or prior to the division of ABaraapp showed MI transformation. By contrast, of 686 animals in which the his-9(H113D) array was present in the postmitotic ABaraappaaa cell, 293 animals (43%) displayed MI transformation, suggesting that his-9 gain-of-function activity acts cell-autonomously to cause MI transformation. In addition, we identified 38 animals in which the array had been lost at the cell division of either ABaraappa or ABaraappaa. Three of these thirty-eight animals (3%) showed MI transformation. This low fraction of MI transformation compared to that of the animals in which the array was present in the postmitotic ABaraappaaa cell (43%) likely reflects two groups among the 38 animals, one in which the array had been lost at the ABaraappa division and another in which the array loss had occurred at the ABaraappaa division. Together these observations suggest that the presence of the his-9(H113D) transgene in ABaraappaa, the MI mother cell, is sufficient to cause MI transformation. We concluded that his-9 gain-of-function activity cell-autonomously acts in the MI mother cell to cause MI transformation."

Involved	"WBbt:0005832"	Sufficient	"To understand how the (AWC-ON/AWC-OFF) decision is made, we used genetic mosaic analysis to examine animals in which the two AWCs had different levels of olrn-1 gene activity. To separate cell-intrinsic functions of olrn-1 from possible network functions, we generated mosaics overexpressing OLRN-1 in one AWC in nsy-5 mutants. In these experiments,olrn-1(OE) behaved exactly as it did in the wild-type background, specifically converting the olrn-1-expressing neuron to AWCON. These results suggest that olrn-1 functions independently of, and most likely downstream of nsy-5 in AWCON."

Two genetic mosaics with losses in the EMS founder cell, which is a precursor to the somatic gonad, were fertile in both gonad arms. These genetic mosaics produced GFP-containing progeny, indicating that their germ lines were twk-1(+). A third genetic mosaic animal resulted from complex losses within the Z1 lineage . This animal was fertile in the anterior gonad arm, but was sterile in the posterior gonad arm. All gonadal sheath cells in the anterior gonad arm of this mosaic were twk-1(tn1397) mutant, but the germline and several anterior spermathecal cells were twk-1(+). A fourth genetic mosaic, resulting from a loss in the Z4 somatic gonadal precursor cell (and some cells within the C lineage), was fertile in the posterior gonad arm, but not the anterior gonad arm. The germ line of this animal was also twk-1(+). We conclude that twk-1 functions downstream of acy-4 in the somatic gonad to regulate meiotic maturation."

Involved	"WBbt:0006827"	Sufficient	"To test for a cell autonomous role of UNC-34 in CAN cell migration, we expressed an unc-34 cDNA tagged with GFP from a ceh-23 promoter, which drove expression in the CAN and in a small subset of sensory neurons. In the null mutant unc-34(e951), only 24% of the CAN cells migrate to the wild-type location. Expression of UNC-34::GFP within the CAN increases the number of cells that reach the wild-type location to 75%. Thus, UNC-34 expression within the CAN is capable of rescuing a significant portion of the unc-34(e951) CAN cell migration defects. These results indicate that UNC-34 acts in the CAN cell to promote its migration."

In gonad-ablated daf-18(lf) let-60(gf) double mutants, vulval induction was higher than in gonad-ablated let-60(gf) single mutants, indicating that DAF-18 represses vulval induction independently of a signal from the gonad.

When expressed from the CAN-specific promoter (PCAN::vab-8s), but not the control minimal pes-10 promoter, VAB-8S also restored full inhibition to vulval fate signaling in P6.p in egfr/let-23(lf); vab-8(gm138) double mutant.vulval fate signaling in P6.p in egfr/let-23(lf); vab-8(gm138) double mutants. This transgene also fully suppressed the other vab-8(gm138) epidermal phenotypes, including the ectopic vulval fates at P8.p, the increased frequency of P3.p becoming a vulval progenitor, and the P-Rvl phenotype (0%, n=64). Thus, VAB-8 acts in the CANs to regulate epidermal development."

However, of those animals displaying normal migration of at least one of the two CAN cell bodies, CAN-expressed Ror/CAM-1 completely restored the parental egf/lin-3(lf) underinduced phenotype. This result indicates that epidermal progenitors such as P6.p no longer receive abnormally high Wnt signaling when Ror/CAM-1 is expressed only in the CANs of cam-1(null) mutants."

We started with a strain that was mutant for cam-1 and ncl-1. The strain also bore an extra-chromosomal transgenic array that contained the wild-type cam-1 and ncl-1 genes as well as a dominant allele of the rol-6 gene that causes animals to roll. Approximately 45% of the Ncl ALMs displayed a polarity defect, but none of the 459 ALMs with wild-type nucleoli displayed a polarity defect.  These observations strongly support the hypothesis that cam-1 acts in the ALM to promote normal polarity"

One explanation for this effect is that CAM-1 has antagonistic activities in ALM polarity: an autonomous function as a Wnt receptor that promotes normal polarity, and a nonautonomous function that antagonizes Wnt function. To test this hypothesis further, we expressed CAM-1 from the myo-3 promoter in muscle cells. This expression resulted in a strong ALM polarity defect in a cam-1 mutant background, consistent with our hypothesis that CAM-1 has antagonistic functions."
