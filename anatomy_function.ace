We determined the cell division at which the array had been mitotically lost by scoring the presence or absence of the array in cells that shared a precursor cell with ABaraappaaa at some point of their lineage history. We identified 10 animals that had an extra e3D-like cell and had lost the array at the cell division of ABaraapp (Fig. 3E). This observation indicates that the presence of a functional ngn-1 gene in ABaraapp is insufficient to generate an MI neuron and thus that to generate MI a functional ngn-1 gene is necessary at or later than the stage of ABaraappa, the MI grandmother cell. By contrast, we identified no animals that had lost the array at the next cell division, that of the MI grandmother cell, ABaraappa (Fig. 3E). This result suggests that in all animals in which the array was present in the MI grandmother cell, ABaraappaaa differentiated as normal into an MI neuron whether the array was (Class I animals) or was not (Class II animals) transmitted to the presumptive MI neuron. Thus, the presence of the array in the MI grandmother cell was sufficient to rescue the MI transformation of ngn-1(n1921) mutants. Together, these findings indicate that the presence of the ngn-1 wild-type gene in the MI grandmother cell is both necessary and sufficient to generate an MI neuron and establish left-right asymmetry in the cell lineage."

To achieve this, we conducted mosaic analysis using cosmid R13H8 (which contains the complete A and B DAF-16 isoforms, but not D or F isoforms) in daf16(mgDF47) mutant animals. Examination of mosaic animals revealed that animals retaining the array in AIY were rescued for the neurite outgrowth phenotype. Conversely, animals that did not retain the array in AIY, but retained it in other cells, were not rescued for the neurite outgrowth phenotype in AIY."

We observed that none of the 45 animals in which the array loss had occurred at or prior to the division of ABaraapp showed MI transformation. By contrast, of 686 animals in which the his-9(H113D) array was present in the postmitotic ABaraappaaa cell, 293 animals (43%) displayed MI transformation, suggesting that his-9 gain-of-function activity acts cell-autonomously to cause MI transformation. In addition, we identified 38 animals in which the array had been lost at the cell division of either ABaraappa or ABaraappaa. Three of these thirty-eight animals (3%) showed MI transformation. This low fraction of MI transformation compared to that of the animals in which the array was present in the postmitotic ABaraappaaa cell (43%) likely reflects two groups among the 38 animals, one in which the array had been lost at the ABaraappa division and another in which the array loss had occurred at the ABaraappaa division. Together these observations suggest that the presence of the his-9(H113D) transgene in ABaraappaa, the MI mother cell, is sufficient to cause MI transformation. We concluded that his-9 gain-of-function activity cell-autonomously acts in the MI mother cell to cause MI transformation."

The partial penetrance of tir-1 mutations was problematic for mosaic analysis, so the gain-of-function phenotype of tir-1 overexpression was used.

The arr-1(ok401) adaptation defect was fully rescued in both transgenic strains."
Involved	"WBbt:0005665"	Sufficient	"To determine whether the defects in adaptation in arr-1(ok401) animals were because of the loss of ARR-1 in the chemosensory neurons, 2.7 kb of the odr-3 promoter was used to drive expression of wild-type ARR-1 (ODR-3::WT) or C-terminally truncated ARR-1 (ODR-3::1â€“368) in the AWC neurons of arr-1(ok401) null mutants. These transgenic strains were then tested for their ability to adapt to isoamyl alcohol in both the standard adaptation and time course chemotaxis assays. The arr-1(ok401) adaptation defect was fully rescued in both transgenic strains."
